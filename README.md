# Insurance-Project
Machine Learning POC project with the Insurance client.

We have taken one Kaggle problem to set an apporach while doing one POC project in our current Organization.


# Use case - 

Our client is an Insurance company which provides different products like term insurance , health insurance , annuties to its customers. Through this excercise  of  building a ML model we will  predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.


In this project we have used Naive Bayes Model and Random forest model for the classification. 

Techniques Used- 

Machine Learning Model - Random forest , Naive bayes
Programming Language - Python
Visualization - Seaborn , matplotlib
Tools - Flask , flasgger
